Genesis
==================================================

Chapter 1
--------------------
1 In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
2 And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness
3 was
4 upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.
5 And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.
6 And God saw the light, that
7 it was
8 good: and God divided the light from the darkness.
9 And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.
11 And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.
12 And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which
13 were
14 under the firmament from the waters which
15 were
16 above the firmament: and it was so.
17 And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day.
19 And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry
20 land
21 appear: and it was so.
22 And God called the dry
23 land
24 Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that
25 it was
26 good.
27 And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed,
28 and
29 the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed
30 is
31 in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.

Chapter 2
--------------------
1 Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.
2 And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.
3 And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.
5 These
6 are
7 the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the
8 LORD
9 God made the earth and the heavens,
10 and every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the
11 LORD
12 God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and
13 there was
14 not a man to till the ground.
15 But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.
16 And the
17 LORD
18 God formed man
19 of
20 the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.
22 And the
23 LORD
24 God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed.
